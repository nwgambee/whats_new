# What's New?

This application was built with `create-react-app`.

### Set Up

Clone down Repo and run `npm install` after navigating into the directory. 
Run `npm start` to start the local server. If this does not happen automatically, navigate to `localhost:3000` in a new browser tab. 

### Expectations / Rules

Build a React App that displays different categories of current news.

We want to see good commit habits - atomic commits that log small, focused changesets.
